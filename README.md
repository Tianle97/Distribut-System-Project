 *Use the JAX-RS/Jersey, Java RMI and JAXB frameworks to develop a simple Car Hire
Booking System. A Web Client page should provide users with the ability to Create/Modify/Update/Delete
bookings for a specific vehicle for a given set of dates. The Web Client will interact with a RESTful JAX-RS
Web Service for bookings which is deployed on Apache Tomcat Server. The RESTful Web Service will act as
a RMI client to a RMI Database Server which will handle persistence.*
